# hoiOnto
This project is a HOI ontology construction project that can be utilized in the HOI research field. HOI Ontology supports interoperability of different HOI Datasets. Also, you can efficiently search for information through the query you want, and create an integrated dataset that can be used additionally. More information on how to use it can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1J8mN63bNIrTdBQzq7Lpjp4qxMXgYI-yF?usp=sharing).

## Installation
1. Clone:
```Shell
git clone --recursive https://github.com/aryoungkim/hoiOnto.git
```
2. Download data,annotations:
```Shell
bash download_data.sh
```
### Dataset

#### HICO-DET
HICO-DET dataset can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1QZcJmGVlF9f4h-XLWe9Gkmnmj2z1gSnk). After finishing downloading, unpack the tarball (`hico_20160224_det.tar.gz`) to the `data` directory.

Instead of using the original annotations files, we use the annotation files provided by the PPDM authors. The annotation files can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1WI-gsNLS-t0Kh8TVki1wXqc3y2Ow1f2R). The downloaded annotation files have to be placed as follows.
```
qpic
 |─ data
 │   └─ hico_20160224_det
 |       |─ annotations
 |       |   |─ trainval_hico.json
 |       |   |─ test_hico.json
 |       |   └─ corre_hico.npy
 :       :
```

#### V-COCO
First clone the repository of V-COCO from [here](https://github.com/s-gupta/v-coco), and then follow the instruction to generate the file `instances_vcoco_all_2014.json`. Next, download the prior file `prior.pickle` from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10uuzvMUCVVv95-xAZg5KS94QXm7QXZW4). Place the files and make directories as follows.
```
qpic
 |─ data
 │   └─ v-coco
 |       |─ data
 |       |   |─ instances_vcoco_all_2014.json
 |       |   :
 |       |─ prior.pickle
 |       |─ images
 |       |   |─ train2014
 |       |   |   |─ COCO_train2014_000000000009.jpg
 |       |   |   :
 |       |   └─ val2014
 |       |       |─ COCO_val2014_000000000042.jpg
 |       |       :
 |       |─ annotations
 :       :
```
For our implementation, the annotation file have to be converted to the HOIA format. The conversion can be conducted as follows.
